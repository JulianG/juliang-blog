**Hello! I'm Julian.**  
**I have 12+ yearsâ€™ experience developing mobile and web applications.**

I use SOLID principles and best practices to write well architectured code that is easy to understand, expresses intention, is easy to maintain and scale, and is properly tested.

My preferred tech stack is:  
**React, TypeScript, ES6, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jest.**  
**GraphQL, REST, Node.js, Webpack, npm.**  
**Git, Jenkins, Travis CI.**  

I also have experience with:  
**Angular, C++, C#, Python, ActionScript**  
**JSON-RPC, SVN, Jenkins.**  

I made an open-source Chrome extension called [Banana Tabs](https://github.com/JulianG/bananatabs).

The rest of the pages are some blog posts I write from time to time.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulianGWeb) and [GitHub](https://github.com/JulianG/).
