**Hello! My name is Julian.**  
**I've been developing mobile and web applications for the last 18 years.**

![keyboard](./images/keyboard.jpg)

I use SOLID principles and best practices to write well-architectured code that expresses intention, is easy to understand, maintain and scale, and is properly tested.

My preferred tech stack is:  
**React, TypeScript, ES6, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jest.**  
**GraphQL, REST, Node.js, Webpack, npm.**  
**Git, Jenkins, Travis CI.**  

I also have experience with:  
**Angular, C++, C#, Python, ActionScript**  
**JSON-RPC, SVN.**  

I'm currently working at [King.com](https://king.com/) creating tools for game development teams.

I made an open-source Chrome extension called [Banana Tabs](https://github.com/JulianG/bananatabs).  
Some people find it extremely useful, others have completely ignored it.

I've finally started writing a blog: [I Have To Write This Down](/blog).  
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulianGWeb) and [GitHub](https://github.com/JulianG/).
