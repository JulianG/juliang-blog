**Hello! I'm Julian.**  
**I have 18 yearsâ€™ experience developing mobile and web applications.**

![keyboard](./keyboard.jpg)

I use SOLID principles and best practices to write well-architectured code that is easy to understand, expresses intention, is easy to maintain and scale, and is properly tested.

My preferred tech stack is:  
**React, TypeScript, ES6, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jest.**  
**GraphQL, REST, Node.js, Webpack, npm.**  
**Git, Jenkins, Travis CI.**  

I also have experience with:  
**Angular, C++, C#, Python, ActionScript**  
**JSON-RPC, SVN, Jenkins.**  

I'm currently working at King.com creating tools for game development teams.

Last year I made an open-source Chrome extension called [Banana Tabs](https://github.com/JulianG/bananatabs).

In the past I help develop successful mobile games such as Farm Heroes Saga and Shuffle Cats.

The rest of the pages are some blog posts I write from time to time.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulianGWeb) and [GitHub](https://github.com/JulianG/).
