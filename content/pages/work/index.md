# Work

I'm currently working at **[King.com](https://king.com/)** creating tools for game development teams.  
We mostly use React and TypeScript.

Before that I helped develop successful mobile games such as [Farm Heroes Saga](https://king.com/game/farmheroes) and [Shuffle Cats](https://king.com/game/shufflecats).  
We used C++ and Actionscript.

----

During my time at **Miniclip.com** I created video games for the browser.

We developed singleplayer and multiplayer games in ActionScript 3.  
We also developed components to integrate third party games with Miniclip's systems.  
I also contributed with some server-side PHP code.

----

Before moving to the UK, I was a **Freelance Web Developer**.  
I developed corporate websites for several clients and design agencies using HTML CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Flash.

----

I started my career as a front-end developer at **CyberJuegos.com** during the dot-com bubble, building web pages using HTML, CSS, and some ASP.  
Later on I was involved in game development in Macromedia Shockwave.
