### Has this ever happened to you?

You keep lots of tabs in a single window to the point where you can't tell what's what anymore.

Or worse: you try -like me- to to group your tabs by task, or subject, or anything, and as a result you end up with too many windows instead:

### Banana Tabs can help

[**Banana Tabs**](https://goo.gl/AyrUQL) is a chrome extension that displays a list of your currently opened browser windows and the tabs contained in each of them.

You can show or hide each tab or window individually. Ideal to suspend some task and picking it up later. You can also re-arrange your windows in the list.

You can install [Banana Tabs!](https://goo.gl/AyrUQL) from the Chrome Web Store.

Banana Tabs is open-source: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/julianG/bananatabs).
