This is my first post on my new Gatsby + Netlify blog.

I plan to use this blog to share as I learn React, TypesScript and related tech.

If everything goes well I should be able to highlight blocks of code like the one below.

```typescript
type Banana = {
  color: number,
  length: number
};
```

OK. That seems to work.
