**Hello! My name is Julian.**  
**I've been developing mobile and web applications since 2001.**

![keyboard](./images/keyboard.jpg)

I use SOLID principles and best practices to write well-architectured code that expresses intention, is easy to understand, maintain and scale, and is properly tested.

I usually work with:  
**React, TypeScript, Next.js, Jest, React Testing Library.**  
**REST, Node.js.**  
**Git, Cicle CI, Travis CI.**

I also have experience with:  
**Angular, C++, C#, Python, ActionScript, PHP**  
**JSON-RPC, SVN.**

I'm currently working at **[TransferWise](https://transferwise.com)** as a Front End Engineer.

I made an open-source Chrome extension called [Banana Tabs](https://github.com/JulianG/bananatabs).  
Some people find it useful, others completely ignore it.

I've finally started writing a blog: [I Have To Write This Down](/blog).  
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulianGWeb) and [GitHub](https://github.com/JulianG/).
